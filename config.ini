                Neha, a teacher in a low-income government school in rural Nashik, Maharashtra, noticed that her student Arjun, who has autism, might find the upcoming change of his math teacher overwhelming. The current teacher was going on maternity leave, and a new teacher would soon be taking over. (Communicating Early), Neha informed Arjun's parents about the new teacher, giving them time to prepare him at home (Involving Parents). Together, they explained the change to Arjun (Explaining Changes), helping him feel more in control. Neha also created a visual schedule with pictures (Using Visual Supports) to clarify the new routine and reviewed it with him every morning. Before the new teacher started, they practiced the steps (Practicing New Routine) so Arjun would know what to expect. On the first day, Neha reassured him (Offering Reassurance) that it was okay to feel nervous and reminded him she was there to support him. She also allowed Arjun extra breaks to adjust (Being Flexible and Patient). By the end of the week, Arjun was more comfortable and confident, and the change became less overwhelming. \
